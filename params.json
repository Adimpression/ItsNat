Adimpression proudly uses ItsNat for most of its websites. \r\n\r\n## Why? \r\n\r\n### Because ItsNat gives full control over the users browser experience. FULL CONTROL.\r\n### Because ItsNat is open sourced\r\n### Because ItsNat is probably the best documented web framework around. All documentation are inline with live running examples and usable code snippets.\r\n### Because ItsNat allows the designers do their job on UI, and allows the developer do Java. There's not custom tags(not mandated). So no messing up of each others work.\r\n### There's more, but its so much more that we can't mention them here.\r\n\r\n## Where?\r\n\r\n### In our Thank God It Is Friday service to our clients\r\n### In I Like Places","google":"UA-41791837-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
