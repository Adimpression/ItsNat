- DHTML on the server. Automatic client synchronization from server

- Some support of automatic server synchronization from client

- Web-continuations ("continue" events)

- User defined event types

- AJAX Timers

- Long running asynchronous server tasks (client is notified when finished)

- COMET without special application servers

- Server side DOM utils (to simplify DOM manipulation like lists, trees, ElementCSSInlineStyle

- support etc)

- Resolution of ${} based variables in markup (helps to keep Java DOM code as agnostic as

- possible of the concrete layout)

- Markup fragments (dynamic parts of the page to be inserted in any time very useful in

- Single Page Interface)

- DOM subtrees in server not going to be used anymore can be removed only in server saving memory (disconnected child nodes)

- SVG (and other namespaces) embedded inline on XHTML and application/xhtml+xml MIME

- SVG (and other namespaces) embedded inline on X/HTML and text/html MIME on

>- Browsers with native SVG

>- MSIE with Adobe SVG Viewer (v3.0 or v6.0 beta) plugin including dynamic processing of SVG DOM

>- Any browser with Flash support using SVGWeb

- Pure SVG documents including AJAX in browsers with native SVG or MSIE with Adobe SVG

- Viewer or Renesis Player v1.1 or Savarese Ssrc SVG/XUL plugin.

- Pure XUL documents including AJAX in Gecko browsers (like FireFox) or MSIE with

- Savarese Ssrc SVG/XUL plugin.

- XML generation

>- IFRAME, OBJECT, EMBED or APPLET tags are automatically bound to the parent document in server . This feature works with:

>- X/HTML loaded by an IFRAME

>- SVG loaded by an IFRAME/OBJECT/EMBED in browsers with native SVG or MSIE with Adobe SVG Viewer or Renesis   or Savarese Ssrc SVG/XUL (only OBJECT and EMBED)

- SVG loaded by Batik applet (custom version for ItsNat) in an APPLET/OBJECT/EMBED

- Java to JavaScript generation utilities

- Server-sent events (events fired by the server sent to the client simulating user actions) with the real browser   or simulated   for instance to test the client view simulating user actions   or simulating the client in server

- Referrers: in page navigation, the previous document in server can be obtained to copy any data avoiding session data in page based applications. Navigation includes back/forward/reload support  . Two modes: push  and pull
