<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows a free list component.</p>

    <p>The differences between this Pocket IE/Motorola Symphony/UCWEB focused free combo box example and
    a normal one are the same as the case of a free combobox.
    </p>

    <p>Besides those differences the component is configured as <code>setSelectionUsesKeyboard(false)</code>
        because in mobile devices keyboard is missing or emulated on screen
        and using CTRL key (for multiple selection) is impossible or not practical.
