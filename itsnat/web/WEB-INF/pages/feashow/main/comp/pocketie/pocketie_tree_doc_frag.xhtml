<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows a free tree based component.</p>

    <p>There are several significative differences compared with the "normal" example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Handle, icon and label are covered with links.
        These links are used to receive mouse events to expand/collapse and select tree nodes
        as a workaround to surpass Pocket IE/Symphony/UCWEB limitations (see "Free Combo Box"
        explanation for more info).
        <br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>The component is configured as <code>setSelectionUsesKeyboard(false)</code>
            because all of them are mobile browsers.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This example uses the same <code>FreeTreeDecorator</code> class
    used in any other tree example (including the main tree of the Feature Showcase),
    because this class detects an HTML tree ready to work with links as wrappers.
